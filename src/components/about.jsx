        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Nicol치s Bauz치 Scaffo. I am from Montevideo Uruguay. Since I
          was a child, I always felt a great attraction for technology; which
          encouraged me to take this path. During my life I not only dedicated
          myself to this, but I was also in the Army for more than 11 years;
          where I learned a fundamental pillar for working life: Discipline. I
          had the opportunity to work for the United Nations in Democratic
          Republic of Congo (Africa) where I gained a lot of experience in
          leading human groups and teamwork. If you slide you can see some of
          the projects i have worked on.
