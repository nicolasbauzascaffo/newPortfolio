        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Nicol치s Bauz치, and I am from Montevideo, Uruguay.
          Since childhood, I have always been deeply drawn to technology, which
          inspired me to pursue a career in this field. In addition to my
          passion for tech, I served in the Army for over 11 years, where I
          learned a key principle that has shaped my professional life:
          discipline. I also had the privilege of working with the United
          Nations in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where I gained valuable
          experience in leadership and teamwork. Currently, I am pursuing a
          Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. If you scroll through, you will
          find some of the projects I have worked on.
